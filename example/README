Included here is an example log file. When you have mastered setting
up your iptables logging through the syslogd of your choice, the
result should be a daily or weekly rotated file which content should
look like this file.

Let's examine a single row from the logfile and look ad the data in
the file:

May  4 06:35:08 zathras kernel: [1749207.946614] IPT: CBLK IN=eth0 
OUT= MAC=02:00:bc:7e:5d:a0:00:13:5f:21:29:40:08:00 
SRC=46.45.161.187 DST=188.126.93.160 LEN=40 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 
TTL=56 ID=10028 PROTO=TCP SPT=55844 DPT=445 WINDOW=512 
RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 

(Line has been terminated for ease of display, in reality it is all
written on the same line)

The first part is a time stamp from the syslog daemon. The next is the
host name and the logging level (kernel) and then we have the kernel
time stamp. This can be regarded as an "id" for the line as the kernel
guarantees there will never be two such lines with the same time
stamp.

Then we have the MARKER called "IPT:" this is what the parser looks
for in order to recognize the line as being an iptables log line. The
next field is a text field chosen in the iptables rules, generally you
will see things like ACCEPT or DROP but in this case you can also
define your own, I have here defined a "country block" rule that is in
effekt. This part should say something about what has happened with
the ip packet.

IN=eth0 is the input interface, as this is an input chain rule there
is no OUT= definition. Then comes the interface MAC= address and then
SRC= ip address of the sender of the packet, the DST= is the
destination IP (often this host but could potentially be some other
host also) the LEN= is the length, we then have some other parameters
that ipta is not currently looking at and then we get the protocol
type in PROTO= we get the source port number in SPT= and destination
port number in DST=, these ipta will look at.
