\chapter{Building the software}

The ipta software is delivered as a software package and needs to be built for the platform you want to run it on. However the result is a single executable file which can easily be packaged and deployed in any software distribution you see fit. 

The license in chapter \ref{license} grants you the right to deploy the software in any situation you seem fit, you are also free to modify the software and I only ask that if you make substantial improvements or bug fixes that you send them to me for consideration into the main software stream so others may benefit from this.

\begin{verbatim}
# apt-get install gcc
# apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
# apt-get install git
\end{verbatim}

Get the latest software package from the github repository:

\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone https://github.com/sikvall/ipta
\end{verbatim}
