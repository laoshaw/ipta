The manual is seriously lagging behind and I apologise for that. I
will try to add a proper manual shortly that will both be possible to
build using a proper make file and a full PDF that can be used by
anyone who do not have the full fledged LaTeX system installed.

Added 2015-05-14: New manual i starting to take shape and will likely
be released within a few weeks time. It will be re-written in LaTeX
and it can also be compiled and therefore distributed as source
through the git repository.
