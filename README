This is the README file for ipta - ip tables analyzer

======================================================================
The Uberquick summary
======================================================================

First of all what do we find in the different directories in this
package?

src/	 This contains the source code. 

manual/	 This contains the manual as LaTeX to be built

example/ This contains example file of logger output and explanation

To make the source enter the src and type "make all"
To make the manual enter the manual dir and type "make"

You need to have libmysql-dev and a latex system installed, see later
in this make file how to install them or consult the full manual for
more useful hints and tips.

ipta relies on iptables and syslog to perform the logging. It then
relies on mysql as the database engine to to the analysis and reports
you want.

======================================================================
Onto the actual stuff
======================================================================


1. COMPILING THE BINARIES FROM SOUCE
------------------------------------

To compile this you need to first install the mysql libraries and
header files. On Ubuntu this is simply done by:

$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

After that you should be able to make the source code into the binary
you need by simply issuing the following:

$ make all

To install on the current system you should do

$ sudo make install

This will install the binary properly.

2. CREATING DEFAULT DATABASE
----------------------------

Create in your local mysql or other mysql server the following:

username: ipta
password: ipta
database: ipta

This is the default user unless you tell it something else using any
of the directives to control this such as:

--db-name <database name> 

	  Use the databas named instead of "ipta" which is the default
	  one. This is the recommended way

--db-user <database user>

	  Use a different user from the default "ipta" user

--db-pass, --db-pass-i

	   Use a different password. The last version is interactive
	   and will read the password from the console rather than the
	   command line where it may show up in a process table or
	   something else nasty.
