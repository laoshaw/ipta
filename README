This is the README file for ipta - ip tables analyzer

1. COMPILING THE BINARIES FROM SOUCE
====================================

To compile this you need to first install the mysql libraries and
header files. On Ubuntu this is simply done by:

$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

After that you should be able to make the source code into the binary
you need by simply issuing the following:

$ make all

To install on the current system you should do

$ sudo make install

This will install the binary properly.

2. CREATING DEFAULT DATABASE
============================

Create in your local mysql or other mysql server the following:

username: ipta
password: ipta
database: ipta

This is the default user unless you tell it something else using any
of the directives to control this such as:

--db-name <database name> 

	  Use the databas named instead of "ipta" which is the default
	  one. This is the recommended way

--db-user <database user>

	  Use a different user from the default "ipta" user

--db-pass, --db-pass-i

	   Use a different password. The last version is interactive
	   and will read the password from the console rather than the
	   command line where it may show up in a process table or
	   something else nasty.
